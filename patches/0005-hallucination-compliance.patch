+## AI Hallucination Prevention Compliance
+
+To be production-compliant:
+
+- All AI prompts MUST include EngineTruth
+- AI outputs MUST be validated against provided engine facts
+- Any deviation constitutes a severity-1 compliance violation
+
+The system MUST log:
+- EngineTruth payload
+- AI prompt
+- AI response
+
+This guarantees auditability and deterministic failure analysis.
