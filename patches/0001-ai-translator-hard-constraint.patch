+## AI Reasoning Constraint (Hard Requirement)
+
+The AI Coach SHALL NOT calculate, infer, or evaluate chess positions.
+
+All chess correctness MUST be derived exclusively from engine-provided facts,
+including:
+- Evaluation scores
+- Best moves
+- Threat identification
+
+The AI Coach’s responsibility is strictly limited to translating verified
+engine truth into Socratic-style pedagogical guidance.
+
+Any AI response that introduces new chess facts not present in the engine
+context SHALL be treated as a critical system failure.
